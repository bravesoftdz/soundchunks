# GliGli's SoundChunks audio codec

The goal of this project is to provide a novel lossy compressor of audio streams so that the decoder is so trivial to compute that even eg. MC68000 platforms can decode it with low CPU overhead.

So far, the encoder works reliably and a reference decoder is provided for further implementation help.

At full bitrate, quality is slightly better than ADPCM, and bitrate is lower.
